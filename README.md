# Influxdb js client
Lightweight library for sending metrics to influxdb in javascirpt

----------

## Why another libray?

Others influxdb js libaries are intented to use with node.js, so they are big in size and just to complicated for this simple job.

this libary just taking simple data and transform it to [influxdb line protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.13/write_protocols/line/)

## What's the difference between this libary and sending simple xhr?

 1. this library transform plain objects into valid line protocol
 2. give you easy way to send points in batch
 3. "lose as less points as possible" by using navigator.sendBeacon when the user leave the page and there is some unsend data(OFF by default)
 4. only **2 KB minified** size

# How to use?

include influxdb.min.js in your page:

*the unminifed version is in es6 if you want to use the unminifed version than you need to transform the code to es5 using [babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/)
```html
<script src="/js/influxdb.min.js"></script>
```

connect to the server:

(its not sending anything just constructing the class)
```javascript
influxdb = new Influxdb('http://127.0.0.1:8086/write?db=DBNAME',true);
```
replace 127.0.0.1 with the ip/url of your influxdb server, change DBNAME with the name of the db you want send points to;

insert points:
```javascript
influxdb.point('key',{value:1},{tag:'tag_name'});
influxdb.point('key',{value:2,other_value:3},{tag:'tag_name',othertag:'some_value'});
```
send the points:

```javascript
influxdb.send();
```


you can also use the short verse like:

```javascript
influxdb.point('key',{value:1},{tag:'tag_name'}).send();
```

## Using sendRaw()

```html
  <div>
    <p>
    Title
    <input type="text" required name=title>
    </p>
    <p>
    Annotation
    <input type="text" required name=annotation>
    </p>
    <p>
    Tags
    <input type="text" required name=tags>
    </p>
    <p>
    <input type="submit">
    </p>
  </div>
```

```javascript
  influxdb = new Influxdb('http://server:8086/write?db=mydb&precision=ms',false);

  title = document.myForm.title.value;
  annotation = document.myForm.annotation.value;
  tags = document.myForm.tags.value;

  influxEntry = 'events title="' + title +'",text="' + annotation + '",tags="' + tags + '" ' + time +'';

  // My extension in influxdb.js to allow sending pre-formatted data (raw). Use sendRaw
  //influxdb.send();
  influxdb.sendRaw(influxEntry);
```

# Api

```javascript
Influxdb.constructor(host, sendPointsOnClose)
```

 - host - should get url to send the points to like: `http://127.0.0.1:8086/write?db=DBNAME`
  - if your db has auth enabled(which should be) apped the username and password according to the docs like `http://127.0.0.1:8086/write?db=DBNAME&u=username&p=password`
  - if you sending custom time with your point append the precision like:
 `http://127.0.0.1:8086/write?db=DBNAME&u=username&p=password&precision=ms` possible values are `precision=[n,u,ms,s,m,h]` for nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and hours, respectively. if you use Date.now() as time than use `&precision=ms`
 - for full list option please see the docs for [http write synax](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.13/write_protocols/write_syntax/#http)
 - sendPointsOnClose (default: false) - if set to true than if for some reason there is a points that added to the batch but was no sent yet to the server and the user close the tab\browser it will send the points using the new api `navigator.sendBeacon` if you want to use it in old browser please include the polyfill https://github.com/miguelmota/Navigator.sendBeacon 
 


````.point(key, fields, tags, time)````

each point must have at least key and one fields look here for more info: [influxdb line protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.13/write_protocols/line/)

 - key - `string` the measurement name
 - fields - `object` { alert=true,reason="value above maximum threshold"2}
 - tags - `null|object` { url : "/index", user_id : 1234 }
 - time - `null|string|number` the time in which the data happend (if you use custom time than dont forget to add the precision to influxdb constructor, Date.now() = ms precision)

# Security
always use this libary with [Authentication and Authorization](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.13/administration/authentication_and_authorization/).

+ create a new database for public data for example named `website_public`.
+ create a new user with only `WRITE` privilege for the `website_public` DB.
+ connect to the influxdb server and append the above created user and password to the host url like:
`http://127.0.0.1:8086/write?db=website_public&u=username&p=password`

**pay attention!** always monitor your influxdb server for memory usage as this libary allow anyone to flood your server with unwanted tags [according to the docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.13/guides/hardware_sizing/) low hardware server can handle only 100,000 tags.
never blindly trust the data you get

 
# Example
Gather some statics about the page loading time and sending it to influxdb with same timestamp:
```javascript
influxdb = new Influxdb('http://127.0.0.1:8086/write?db=website&u=website_public&p=12341234&precision=ms',true);

var url = encodeURIComponent(window.location.pathname+window.location.search);
var time = Date.now();

influxdb.point("pageview", {value: 1}, {url: url}, time);

$(window).load(function () {
        if (typeof window.performance != "undefined") {
            var page_latency = window.performance.timing.responseStart - window.performance.timing.connectStart;
            var load_time = window.performance.timing.loadEventStart - window.performance.timing.navigationStart;

            influxdb.point("page_latency", {value: page_latency}, {url: url}, time);
            influxdb.point("load_time", {value: load_time}, {url: url}, time);
            
            influxdb.send();
        }
    });
```

Although we didn't send the 'pageview' point only after window.load is fired, if for some reason the user exit the website before the event is fired the point will sent anyway due to our usage of `sendPointsOnClose` (second argument on the constructer)
